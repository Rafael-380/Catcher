Bugs/Dont forget/upgrades
- Add texture to the backgrounds of the pages
- Texts are misalligned
- The bounding boxes do not represent the real drawing of objects
- Add bananas, 5pts, 1 every 10sec, spawn mechanics equal to apples, fast speed (optional)
- Game over doesn't show that you beat the previous record because the value enters the .txt file when the game finishes
- The first try when I turn on the game with the file already created doesn't show in the top scores (unconfirmed)
- Top score must create the bestScores.txt file when he can't find it. 
- Top score must output: "No scores yet" if it opens the file and there are no players or if it creates it
